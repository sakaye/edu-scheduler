# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-08-user-auth-multitenancy/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Laravel Authentication Setup with Sanctum

**Authentication Foundation:**
- Utilize Laravel 12's streamlined authentication system with default User model extension
- Implement Laravel Sanctum for API token management (future-proofing for mobile/API access)
- Configure session-based authentication as primary method with persistent login capability
- Implement secure password hashing using Laravel's default bcrypt/Argon2 configuration
- Add remember me functionality with configurable session lifetime
- Configure secure cookie settings with SameSite, Secure, and HttpOnly flags

**Session Management:**
- Configure Redis-backed session storage for scalability and performance
- Implement automatic session cleanup for expired/inactive sessions
- Add session security headers (CSRF protection, X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy)
- Implement concurrent session limits per user role (configurable)
- Add session invalidation on password change or role modifications

**Password Security:**
- Implement password reset functionality with secure token generation
- Configure rate limiting for login attempts (5 attempts per minute per IP)
- Add email verification requirement for new account registrations
- Implement secure password validation rules (minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers)

### 2. Filament Multi-Panel Configuration

**Panel Architecture:**
- **Student Panel** (`/student`): Simplified interface for students with read-only scheduling access
- **Staff Panel** (`/staff`): Department-scoped interface for staff members with limited edit capabilities  
- **Admin Panel** (`/admin`): Full department management interface for Department Administrators
- **Super Panel** (`/super`): System-wide administration interface for Super-Admin users

**Panel-Specific Configurations:**
```php
// Student Panel - Minimal interface
- Navigation: Dashboard, My Schedules, Profile
- Theme: Light theme with limited customization
- Middleware: auth, verified, student.access

// Staff Panel - Department-scoped functionality  
- Navigation: Dashboard, Schedules, Students, Profile
- Theme: Standard Filament theme with department branding
- Middleware: auth, verified, staff.access, tenant.context

// Admin Panel - Department management
- Navigation: Dashboard, Users, Departments, Teams, Schedules, Reports
- Theme: Full Filament theme with admin styling
- Middleware: auth, verified, admin.access, tenant.context

// Super Panel - System administration
- Navigation: All entities, System Settings, Global Reports, Audit Logs
- Theme: Enhanced admin theme with system-wide controls
- Middleware: auth, verified, super.access
```

**Panel Security:**
- Implement middleware-based access control for each panel
- Add panel-specific authorization policies
- Configure separate login routes for different user types (optional branded login pages)
- Implement automatic panel redirection based on user role hierarchy

### 3. Multi-Tenancy Implementation Using Teams/Departments

**Tenant Architecture:**
- Implement team-based multi-tenancy using `teams` table as primary tenant entity
- Support many-to-many relationships between users and teams via `team_user` pivot table
- Add `current_team_id` to users table for active team context switching
- Implement tenant-scoped queries using Laravel's global scopes

**Team/Department Structure:**
```php
// Team Model Structure
- id (primary key)
- name (department name, e.g., "Computer Science", "Mathematics")
- slug (URL-friendly identifier)
- department_code (unique identifier, e.g., "CS", "MATH") 
- description (department description)
- is_active (soft enable/disable)
- settings (JSON field for department-specific configurations)
- created_at, updated_at

// Team-User Pivot Structure
- user_id (foreign key to users)
- team_id (foreign key to teams)
- role (student, staff, admin within this team)
- status (pending, approved, suspended)
- joined_at (approval timestamp)
- invited_by (foreign key to inviting user)
- created_at, updated_at
```

**Tenant Context Management:**
- Implement middleware for automatic team context detection
- Add team-switching functionality in navigation
- Scope all queries to current team context (except Super-Admin)
- Implement team-specific data isolation with database constraints

### 4. Role-Based Permissions and Access Control

**Permission Hierarchy:**
```php
// Role Definitions (stored in team_user pivot)
enum UserRole: string 
{
    case STUDENT = 'student';
    case STAFF = 'staff'; 
    case ADMIN = 'admin';
    case SUPER = 'super';
}

// Permission Matrix by Role
Student Permissions:
- view own schedules
- view team information  
- update own profile
- request additional team access

Staff Permissions:
- all student permissions
- view team schedules
- manage assigned courses/schedules
- view team student list

Admin Permissions:  
- all staff permissions
- manage team users (invite, approve, suspend)
- manage team settings and information
- create/edit team schedules and courses
- view team reports and analytics

Super Permissions:
- all admin permissions across all teams
- manage teams (create, edit, delete)
- manage system-wide settings
- access global reports and audit logs
- promote/demote users across teams
```

**Authorization Implementation:**
- Create Laravel Policies for each major entity (User, Team, Schedule, etc.)
- Implement role-based middleware for route protection
- Use Filament's authorization hooks for resource-level permissions
- Add dynamic permission checking based on team membership status

### 5. User Registration and Management Workflows

**Student Self-Registration Flow:**
```php
// Registration Process
1. Student Registration Form:
   - Basic information (name, email, student_id)
   - Department selection (dropdown of available teams)
   - Terms of service acceptance
   - Email verification requirement

2. Account Creation:
   - Create user record with 'unverified' status
   - Send email verification link
   - Create pending team membership request
   - Generate notification to Department Admin

3. Department Approval:
   - Admin receives email notification
   - Admin reviews request in Filament interface
   - Admin can approve/deny with optional message
   - System sends status notification to student

4. Account Activation:
   - Upon approval, student gains team access
   - Student can log in to Student Panel
   - Student can request additional team memberships
```

**Admin-Managed Account Creation:**
```php
// Staff/Admin Creation Process
1. Department Admin Interface:
   - User creation form with role selection
   - Email invitation system
   - Temporary password generation

2. Invitation Process:
   - Send secure invitation email with setup link
   - Time-limited token for account setup (24 hours)
   - User completes profile setup and password creation
   - Automatic team assignment upon completion

3. Role Management:
   - Real-time role updates with permission refresh
   - Role change audit logging
   - Notification system for role modifications
```

### 6. Database Relationships and Constraints

**Core Entity Relationships:**
```sql
-- Users Table (extends Laravel default)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN student_id VARCHAR(255) NULL UNIQUE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN current_team_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_login_at TIMESTAMP NULL;

-- Foreign Key Constraints
ALTER TABLE users ADD FOREIGN KEY (current_team_id) REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Team-User Pivot Constraints
ALTER TABLE team_user ADD UNIQUE KEY unique_user_team_role (user_id, team_id);
ALTER TABLE team_user ADD FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE team_user ADD FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE team_user ADD FOREIGN KEY (invited_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Indexes for Performance
CREATE INDEX idx_team_user_role ON team_user (team_id, role);
CREATE INDEX idx_team_user_status ON team_user (status);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_current_team ON users (current_team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_student_id ON users (student_id);
```

**Data Integrity Rules:**
- Users must have at least one approved team membership to access system
- Super-Admin users bypass team-specific constraints
- Soft delete protection for users with active team memberships
- Cascade deletion rules for maintaining referential integrity
