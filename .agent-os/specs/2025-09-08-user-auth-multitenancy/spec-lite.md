# User Authentication & Multi-Tenant Department System - Lite Summary

Implement a foundational authentication system with department-level multi-tenancy supporting four user roles (Students, Staff, Department Administrators, Super-Admin) and many-to-many user-department relationships. This system establishes secure access control and organizational structure that enables students to self-register and request department access while providing administrators with comprehensive user management capabilities across departmental boundaries. The multi-tenant architecture serves as the critical foundation for all subsequent scheduling system features by ensuring proper data isolation and role-based permissions.

## Key Points
- Four-tier role-based access control with secure authentication foundation
- Department-level multi-tenancy with flexible user-team relationships
- Self-service student registration with approval workflows and administrative oversight
