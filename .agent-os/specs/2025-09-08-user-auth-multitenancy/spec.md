> Spec: User Authentication & Multi-Tenant Department System
> Created: 2025-09-08
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive user authentication system with department-level multi-tenancy that supports four distinct user roles (Students, Department Staff, Department Administrators, Super-Admin) and enables many-to-many relationships between users and department teams. This foundational system will enable secure access control and organizational structure for the educational scheduling application.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Student Self-Registration and Department Access
**As a** student  
**I want to** self-register for an account and request access to my department(s)  
**So that** I can view and manage my class schedules within my department context

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Student visits registration page and provides basic information (name, email, student ID)
2. Student selects their primary department from available options
3. System creates student account with pending department access
4. Department Administrator receives notification to approve/deny access
5. Upon approval, student gains access to department-specific scheduling features
6. Student can later request access to additional departments if needed

### User Story 2: Department Administrator User Management
**As a** Department Administrator  
**I want to** create and manage staff accounts within my department  
**So that** I can control who has access to department resources and their permission levels

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Department Admin accesses user management dashboard
2. Admin creates new staff account with role assignment (Staff or Department Admin)
3. System sends invitation email with temporary password/setup link
4. New user completes account setup and gains appropriate department access
5. Admin can modify user roles, suspend accounts, or transfer users between departments
6. All user management actions are logged for audit purposes

### User Story 3: Super-Admin Cross-Department Management
**As a** Super-Admin  
**I want to** manage users across all departments and system-wide settings  
**So that** I can maintain overall system integrity and handle cross-department issues

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Super-Admin accesses global administration panel
2. Admin can view/modify users across all departments and teams
3. Admin creates new departments and assigns initial Department Administrators
4. Admin handles escalated access requests and cross-department user transfers
5. Admin configures system-wide security policies and authentication settings
6. Admin monitors system activity and generates compliance reports

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-tenant team structure** with department-level isolation and many-to-many user-team relationships
2. **Four-tier role-based access control** (Students, Staff, Department Admins, Super-Admin) with appropriate permissions
3. **Student self-registration workflow** with department access request and approval process
4. **Admin-managed account creation** for staff and administrative users with invitation system
5. **Secure authentication system** using Laravel's built-in features with session management
6. **Department and team management interfaces** for creating, modifying, and organizing departmental structure
7. **User profile management** allowing users to update personal information and view their department memberships
8. **Audit logging system** for tracking user actions, role changes, and access modifications
9. **Email notification system** for account approvals, invitations, and security alerts
10. **Database schema design** supporting flexible user-team relationships and role inheritance

## Out of Scope

- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with external identity providers
- Advanced password policies beyond Laravel defaults
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) implementation
- API authentication tokens for external integrations
- Automated user provisioning from external systems (LDAP/Active Directory)
- Advanced audit reporting and compliance dashboards
- User import/export functionality via CSV or other formats
- Custom permission granularity beyond the four defined roles

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional authentication and multi-tenancy system that demonstrates:

1. **Successful user registration and login** for all four user types with appropriate access controls
2. **Working department/team assignment** with users able to belong to multiple teams and switch contexts
3. **Functional role-based permissions** where each user type can only access appropriate features and data
4. **Complete admin interfaces** for user management, team creation, and access approval workflows
5. **Secure session management** with proper logout, session timeout, and security headers
6. **Email notifications** functioning for account creation, approvals, and security events
7. **Comprehensive test coverage** including unit tests for models/relationships and feature tests for authentication flows
8. **Database migrations** that can be run cleanly on fresh installations
9. **Seed data** providing sample departments, teams, and users for development and testing
10. **Documentation** covering user role permissions, team assignment processes, and admin workflows
