## The Problem

### Legacy System Limitations

Current SARS installations suffer from severe user experience issues that impact student success and staff efficiency. Students struggle with the "dated and arcane" interface, leading to appointment booking friction and higher no-show rates.

**Our Solution:** Replace legacy systems with a modern, intuitive platform that students actually want to use and staff can manage efficiently.

### Integration Bottlenecks

Existing SARS systems lack proper two-way calendar synchronization and have clunky APIs that prevent seamless workflow integration. Staff waste 30+ minutes daily on manual scheduling tasks that should be automated.

**Our Solution:** Provide native integrations with Banner ERP, calendar systems, and communication platforms through modern APIs.

### Mobile Accessibility Gap

Legacy systems provide no mobile support, forcing students to use desktop computers for simple scheduling tasks. This creates barriers to access, particularly for non-traditional and remote students.

**Our Solution:** Deliver mobile-first design with progressive web app capabilities for seamless cross-device experiences.

### Reporting and Analytics Limitations

Current reporting engines offer limited customization and lack real-time insights needed for capacity planning and student success initiatives. Administrators cannot easily identify utilization patterns or intervention opportunities.

**Our Solution:** Implement advanced analytics with customizable dashboards, predictive insights, and automated reporting for data-driven decision making.

## Differentiators
